**JavaScript Unified Reactive Interface Solution**

The First and Only Non-blocking Reactive Platform, Architecturally Optimized for Next Generation Cutting-Edge Cross-Platform Application.
Transforms web development through its comprehensive object-first architecture that makes reactivity an intentional choice rather than an automatic behavior. By expressing interfaces as pure JavaScript objects where functions explicitly define reactivity, Juris delivers a complete solution for applications that are universally deployable, precisely controlled, and designed from the ground up for seamless async/sync data handling AI collaboration—all while maintaining the simplicity and debuggability of native JavaScript patterns without the complexity of build-steps.
